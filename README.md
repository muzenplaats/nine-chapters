  <b>Farm:</b>
  
  I have a farm with width of fifteen feet and height of sixteen feet.
  I would like to ask you how the geometry it is.

      240                                       |<---   15 ft.   -->|
  
  15 ft. x 16 ft. = 240 ft.^2 (= 80/3 yd.^2 = 26 2/3 yd.^2)
  ```
  The one answered me: 
  
  It is two hundred and forty square feet, or twenty six and two third square yard.
